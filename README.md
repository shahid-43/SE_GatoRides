# Description
GatoRides is an effective car ride-sharing platform that aims to disrupt the mobility industry in cities. It features an open application where on one side, people are able to make a request on where to be picked from, and on the other side, drivers can make themselves available and request passengers from wherever they are based.
The proposed app intends to allow passengers to find drivers nearby who are going the same route to offer cheap and convenient services. GatoRides allows users to become both riders, and drivers at the same time, and as such, ensures that the usage of the service is flexible, inclusive, and based on mutual cooperation.
First and foremost, the project is centered on the development of an easy-to-navigate presentation of the service’s primary functionality, which involves looking for or providing rides. The application will contain secure input/output functionality, effective route-matching algorithms, and a clear and distinguishing rating system, which will make interaction with the application successful for all of the participants.
The primary aim of GatoRides is to lessen the rate of congested traffic, constantly high transport charges, and negative impact on the environment as a result of daily commutes. The proposed project aims at helping to develop a strong and efficient transportation system, which the author believes will improve the quality of life in urban communities.
